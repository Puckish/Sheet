Responsive Live Roleplaying Game Character Sheet (First system: 13th Age)

## What's this going to be?
The end plan is a web site for accessing your 13th Age (and other system) character sheets in device-independent formats. We're currently looking at tech to write the back-end in, probably using this as an excuse to learn Golang.

### Whatcha doing now?
At the moment this is just me showing off with HTML/CSS to recreate the 3-column character sheet I created in Photoshop for Adventure For Hire - https://adventureforhire.com/
